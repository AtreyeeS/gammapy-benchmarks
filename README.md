# Gammapy validation and benchmarks

This is the set of validation and benchmarks for Gammapy that we
continuously maintain and improve as we develop Gammapy.

It should always work with the latest Gammapy master, if it doesn't,
send a pull request.

Executing this is manually for now, not part of a continuous integration / deployment setup.

- [validation](validation) - Gammapy correctness checks (model fitting, spectra, lightcurves, ...)
- [benchmarks](benchmarks) - Gammapy Performance checks (time, CPU, RAM)
