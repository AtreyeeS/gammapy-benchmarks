# Gammapy benchmarks and validations

This is the set of validation and benchmarks for Gammapy that we
continuously maintain and improve as we develop Gammapy.

It should always work with the latest Gammapy master. Checks are scheduled nightly and also 
for every push in this repository. If checks fail a notification is sent to Gammapy #dev Slack 
channel. The badge below displays the status of last check.

- [benchmarks](benchmarks) - Gammapy Performance checks (time, CPU, RAM)
- [validation](validation) - Gammapy correctness checks (model fitting, spectra, lightcurves, ...)
