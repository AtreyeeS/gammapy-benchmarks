# Gammapy validation: HESS DL3 DR1 and validation paper

## Task

- Script some or all analyses from the validation paper(s) with the latest Gammapy version
- The analyses are very similar, it should be possible to script them all. That is preferred over manually writing one notebook per target, to simplify maintenance for the Gammapy team.
- Run analyses and compare with the paper(s), report discrepancies as issues in Gammapy, or document why they occur.
