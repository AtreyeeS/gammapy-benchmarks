# Gammapy validation: HESS DL3 DR1 and validation paper

## Task

- Update `gammapy-extra/datasets/hess-dl3-dr1` to include background model (write `make.py` script that combines files and generates new index files). Possibly downsample BG to have smaller files.
- Script some or all analyses from the validation paper(s) with the latest Gammapy version
- Run analyses and compare with the paper(s), report discrepancies as issues in Gammapy, or document why they occur.
