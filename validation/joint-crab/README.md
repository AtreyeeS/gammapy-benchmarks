# Gammapy validation: joint Crab

## Task

- Write a script (or notebook) to reproduce the Joint Crab analysis using the latest Gammapy
- Compare against the paper results
- This will especially test the high-level modeling & fitting code in Gammapy, which is under heavy development (covariance matrix, error ellipses)
